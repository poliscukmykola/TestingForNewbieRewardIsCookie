# (WIP) Testing For Newbie Reward Is Cookie
My personal knowledge transfer focused on testing. This is simply an advice where to start to become Tester (Software Quality Assurance)

## Fresh start
If you have decided to become a Software QA, this is good way how to start. Basically I am going to try to provide you as many information as possible.
First of all Theory of course

## Theory
### Basic Testing Knowledge
[Software Testing Help](htps://www.softwaretestinghelp.com). This provides a several topic I am going to mention here
All testers should know basics of ISTQB.
Tests can be manual and automated. 

### Types Of Testing

A really important page about [testing types](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/types-of-software-testing/) which can be done.

## Basic Knowledge
* [Markdown language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to be able create a file like this. See file extension.
* [JSON](https://quickref.me/json) The most used for f.e. configuration files, storing an object info and so on. 
* [Xpath](https://www.guru99.com/xpath-selenium.html) You can also seea a [Xpath Cheat Sheet](https://devhints.io/xpath)
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) then see more friendly [Git tutorial](https://github.com/janpetru/learn_git) created by my friend Jan Petru. 


## Recommended Tools
### General
[Visual Studio Code (Code Editor)](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## Practice
It really depends what are you more interteted into. User Interface (UI) is about testing what user see on page or test Backend which is everything behind UI like sending API request to server, creating SQL queries and so on. 

### UI Testing
* Selenium is good way to start with. It should provide overall info about automated testing of web pages and test creation. 
* [Testcafe](https://testcafe.io/) is basically same stuff like Selenium but it is way more easier. 

### Backend Testing
* SoapUi
* Postman
