# Testing For Newbie, Reward Is Cookie
## Fresh start
My personal knowledge transfer focused on testing. This is simply an advice where to start to become Tester (Software Quality Assurance) or at least is good to know what it is all about. 

If you have decided to become a Software QA, you need to learn a lot of things. It won't be easy. Basically I am going to try to provide you as many information as possible for easier start.

## Theory
### Basic Testing Knowledge
All testers should know basics of ISTQB. [Software Testing Help](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com) provides definitions and overview of testing basis which I am going to mention here as well. 

### Types Of Testing
Basically all tests are done manually at the first place to be sure that everything is properly developed and tested. Then those tests are transferred to code in some program to make them automated. All automated tests must be covered by manual testing. 

Here you can see all [testing types](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/types-of-software-testing/) which can be done.

## Knowledge Base
You should definitely know following programs or languages

* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) The most used version control tool. You can also see more friendly [Git tutorial](https://github.com/janpetru/learn_git) created by my friend Jan Petru. 
* [Markdown language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to be able create a file like this. See file extension.
* [JSON](https://quickref.me/json) The most used lightweight data-interchange format.
* [Xpath](https://www.guru99.com/xpath-selenium.html) You can also see a [Xpath Cheat Sheet](https://devhints.io/xpath)
* [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) queries are used for creating, editing or deleting data from database. 


### Recommended Tools
[Visual Studio Code (Code Editor)](https://code.visualstudio.com) is also the most popular for file editing which also contains a tons of extensions. 

## Practice
It really depends what are you more interested into. Frontend is focused on User Interface (UI) which is all about testing what user see on page. Backend is everything behind UI like sending API request to server, creating SQL queries and so on. 

### UI Testing
* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) is good way to start with. It should provide overall info about automated testing of web pages and test creation. 
* [Testcafe](https://testcafe.io/) is basically same stuff like Selenium but it is way more easier. 

### Backend Testing
* [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org) is an automated testing tool for SOAP and REST APIs. Open source version should be enough. 
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com) is an API platform for building and using APIs. Same here, free version should be enough to try any API call.

### Important Web Pages
On [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com) you can always find basics for most common languages. For more complicated problems there is always well known [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) if you have a problem, there is always a thread with some solution which is useful, just write a question.
